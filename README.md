Developed a Python application using computational geometry algorithms to find line intersection points and their
convex hull, visualizing the results using Turtle. Conducted a comprehensive study of the implemented algorithms,
evaluating their time complexity and efficiency across diverse datasets to determine their scalability and effectiveness
